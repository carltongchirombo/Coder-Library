    <h2>Cloud Computing Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
        Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. This roadmap outlines the key concepts, service models, deployment models, and learning paths to help you build expertise in cloud computing.

    <h3>Key Service Models</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</strong> Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</strong> Offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development.</li>
        <li><strong>Software as a Service (SaaS):</strong> Delivers software applications over the internet, on a subscription basis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deployment Models</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Cloud:</strong> Services offered over the public internet and available to anyone.</li>
        <li><strong>Private Cloud:</strong> Cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid Cloud:</strong> Combines public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.</li>
