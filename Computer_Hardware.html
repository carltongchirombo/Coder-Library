    <h2>Computer Hardware</h2>
    <p>
        Computer hardware refers to the physical components that make up a computer system. Understanding these components and how they interact is essential for building, upgrading, and maintaining computers.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Hardware Components</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The brain of the computer that executes instructions and processes data.</li>
        <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> The main circuit board that connects all hardware components and allows communication between them.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> Temporary storage that holds data and instructions currently in use by the CPU.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage Devices:</strong> Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD) for long-term data storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):</strong> Handles rendering of images, video, and animations.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU):</strong> Converts electrical power from an outlet into usable power for the computer components.</li>
        <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> Devices like keyboard, mouse, and scanner used to input data into the computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> Devices like monitors, printers, and speakers that output data from the computer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Hardware Components Interact</h3>
    <p>
        The CPU communicates with other components via the motherboard's buses and chipset. RAM provides fast access to data and instructions for the CPU. Storage devices hold data persistently and transfer it to RAM when needed. The GPU processes graphical data and sends it to the display. The PSU supplies power to all components ensuring stable operation.

    <h3>Tips for Upgrading and Maintaining Hardware</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure compatibility between new components and your existing system.</li>
        <li>Keep your system clean and dust-free to prevent overheating.</li>
        <li>Regularly update drivers and firmware for optimal performance.</li>
        <li>Backup important data before making hardware changes.</li>
        <li>Handle components carefully to avoid static damage.</li>
    </ul>
