    <h2>Blockchain Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
        Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that ensures security, transparency, and immutability. This roadmap outlines the key concepts, platforms, and learning paths to help you understand and build expertise in blockchain technology.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Concepts in Blockchain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decentralized Ledger:</strong> A distributed database that is shared and synchronized across multiple sites, institutions, or geographies.</li>
        <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Techniques used to secure transactions and control the creation of new blocks.</li>
        <li><strong>Consensus Mechanisms:</strong> Protocols like Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and others that validate transactions and maintain network integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Types of Blockchains</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Blockchains:</strong> Open networks where anyone can participate (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).</li>
        <li><strong>Private Blockchains:</strong> Restricted networks controlled by a single organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Consortium Blockchains:</strong> Semi-decentralized networks governed by a group of organizations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Popular Blockchain Platforms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin</li>
        <li>Ethereum</li>
        <li>Hyperledger Fabric</li>
        <li>Ripple</li>
        <li>Cardano</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Suggested Learning Path</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Foundations:</strong> Understand basic cryptography, distributed systems, and blockchain principles.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> Learn about blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and consensus algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Explore blockchain development, security, scalability solutions, and decentralized applications (DApps).</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Experience:</strong> Build projects, contribute to open-source blockchain platforms, and participate in blockchain communities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Career Opportunities in Blockchain</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Blockchain Developer</li>
        <li>Smart Contract Engineer</li>
        <li>Blockchain Architect</li>
        <li>Cryptocurrency Analyst</li>
        <li>Blockchain Project Manager</li>
    </ul>
