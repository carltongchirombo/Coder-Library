    <h2>Artificial Intelligence Roadmap</h2>
    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This roadmap outlines the key areas, technologies, and learning paths to help you navigate the AI landscape.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Areas in Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML)</strong>: Algorithms that enable computers to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.</li>
        <li><strong>Deep Learning</strong>: A subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong>: Techniques for understanding, interpreting, and generating human language.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Vision</strong>: Methods for enabling machines to interpret and analyze visual information from the world.</li>
        <li><strong>Robotics</strong>: The design and development of robots that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Suggested Learning Path</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Foundations:</strong> Learn programming languages like Python, mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, probability), and basic algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate:</strong> Study machine learning concepts, data preprocessing, and model evaluation techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Dive into deep learning, neural networks, reinforcement learning, and specialized AI domains like NLP and computer vision.</li>
        <li><strong>Practical Experience:</strong> Work on projects, participate in competitions, and contribute to open-source AI frameworks.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Popular Tools and Frameworks</h3>
    <ul>
