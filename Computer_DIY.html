    <h2>Computer DIY (Do It Yourself)</h2>
    <p>
        Building your own computer can be a rewarding experience that allows you to customize your system to your needs and save money. This guide provides an overview of the essential components, tools, and steps involved in assembling a computer.
    </p>

    <h3>Essential Components</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The brain of the computer that performs instructions.</li>
        <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> The main circuit board that connects all components.</li>
        <li><strong>Memory (RAM):</strong> Temporary storage for data being used by the CPU.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Hard drives (HDD) or solid-state drives (SSD) for long-term data storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Supply Unit (PSU):</strong> Provides power to all components.</li>
        <li><strong>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):</strong> Handles rendering of images and video.</li>
        <li><strong>Case:</strong> The enclosure that houses all components.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooling System:</strong> Fans or liquid cooling to keep components at safe temperatures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tools Needed</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Screwdrivers (usually Phillips-head)</li>
        <li>Anti-static wrist strap</li>
        <li>Thermal paste (if not pre-applied on CPU cooler)</li>
        <li>Cable ties for cable management</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Building Guide</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your workspace and wear an anti-static wrist strap.</li>
        <li>Install the CPU onto the motherboard socket carefully.</li>
        <li>Apply thermal paste if necessary and attach the CPU cooler.</li>
        <li>Install RAM modules into the motherboard slots.</li>
        <li>Mount the motherboard inside the case.</li>
        <li>Install the power supply unit (PSU) in the case.</li>
        <li>Connect storage devices (HDD/SSD) to the motherboard.</li>
        <li>Install the graphics card into the appropriate PCIe slot.</li>
        <li>Connect all power cables from the PSU to the motherboard and components.</li>
        <li>Manage cables neatly using cable ties.</li>
        <li>Double-check all connections and close the case.</li>
        <li>Power on the system and enter BIOS to verify hardware detection.</li>
        <li>Install the operating system and necessary drivers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Check all cable connections if the system does not power on.</li>
        <li>Listen for beep codes from the motherboard to diagnose hardware issues.</li>
        <li>Ensure RAM and GPU are properly seated in their slots.</li>
        <li>Verify that the CPU cooler is properly installed to prevent overheating.</li>
        <li>Consult the motherboard manual for specific troubleshooting steps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Safety Precautions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Always work on a non-conductive surface and avoid static electricity.</li>
        <li>Handle components by their edges to avoid damage.</li>
        <li>Disconnect power before working inside the case.</li>
        <li>Keep liquids away from your workspace.</li>
    </ul>
